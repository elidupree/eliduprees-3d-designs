Big list of considerations after completing first mask prototype:

STRUCTURE:
– Currently, the forehead is shaped exactly for my forehead. Consider how to make the mask more one-size-fits-all.
– Currently, the mask doesn't have much resistance to being tilted up/down or sideways. The only resistance to torque comes from the tension of the headband elastic, combined with the contact force at the forehead. These forces have infinite mechanical disadvantage when the mask is in standard position, so it always end up being slightly tilted. Furthermore, there is always torque on the mask - the weight of the CPAP hose, and also the tension of the elastic that holds the cloth on to the chin. Improve this situation.
– Related to the above, it isn't perfectly comfortable right now – even after I glued some foam onto the forehead part, the force on my forehead is a little high.
– Even when not tilted, the chin piece is within my visual range. Move it lower.
– The mask is too bulky near my ears for me to wear my noise canceling headphones with it. Can this be fixed?
– The intake is currently angled too far out to the side, increasing the unwanted torque and potentially making it more likely to bump into things.
– Consider concerns about whether, in a bicycle crash, mask pieces would break in a dangerous way
– Maybe add a practical way to attach/detach unrelated fabric to cover the neck and back of her head against UV/bugs

PRINTING PRACTICALITIES:
– Probably we will ultimately use a manufacturing process that is not FDM - perhaps Shapeways SLS, perhaps even injection molding.
– The connection between the intake and the frame needs to be stronger (probably just by printing it as one piece; I still need to 3d-model this).
– The forehead piece isn't perfectly printable. Using my home 3D printer, it warped a little. Using SLS or injection molding, it won't be able to print as a hollow solid the same way it currently does. Improve this situation. (This may be rendered moot by structure changes)

FACE SHIELD:
– Glue it on instead of being clever with a slot. (The slot didn't hold it well enough, and also the shield buzzed when I talked.) Probably just remove one side of the slot, so there's an exposed face to glue to. (Keep the outer rim, to help with positioning and to make it so the face doesn't touch other objects if you put it down on a flat surface.)
– Pursue antireflective coating, perhaps http://www.mecanusa.com/polarizer/AR-film/AR_roll.htm.
– Probably use a material that is slightly thicker – we still want it to be possible to curve by hand, but the current version bends a little too easily, making it scrunch up a little under moderate force, which will put more and more bend marks on the surface over time.

CLOTH:
– The current mechanism of attaching the cloth was very inconvenient. Come up with a better one.
– How to properly seal the cloth around the intake?
– Generate a pattern for the cloth.
– Pick a good kind of cloth to use, perhaps based on https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.0c03252
– Research whether there's any automation nowadays that would be less work than "a human manually cuts cloth using the pattern, sews it using a sewing machine, and threads the elastic".

OTHER:
– Can all the materials be heatproof so you can sterilize the mask using heat?
– This isn't about the mask per se, but there wasn't quite enough airflow for me to breathe hard. Make sure the air purifier provides more airflow.



Based on the above:

To deal with the up/down tilt, we need at least one more rigid attachment between the mask and a contact point on the head. Nowhere on the face makes a good contact point, so the natural places to consider are "further up the forehead" and "the back of the head". Using the back of the head requires a directionally-rigid component (a headband that can flex around the head to have a tight grip, but can't bend when viewed from the side of the head). Fortunately, such materials exist, and in fact, they can be 3D printed as part of the same object simply by making them wider in one dimension than the other.

Further up the forehead is trickier because I want it to be possible to wear this mask with a bicycle helmet. Anything further up the forehead would have to go *under* the helmet, but the nature of the mask means that bicycle helmet straps can't go over it and must go under it, so putting both parts under each other would be thoroughly inconvenient at best.

Asymmetric torque, as from the CPAP hose, is harder to deal with, since I prefer not to have ANY asymmetric forces on my head for comfort reasons. There's not much else that is expected to apply asymmetric torque, though, so we should be able to deal with this by simply securing the CPAP hose at the back of the head, as I do with the nose-fitting mask.

… Let's see, with the idea of a directionally-rigid headband, let's see if we can jump off onto the "one-size-fits-all" issue. We need to get rid of the wide, flat, rigid forehead piece; whatever we replace it with has to accomplish the same 2 goals: attach to the top edge of the face shield and block air from escaping between the forehead and the shield. It also must be rigid enough not to dip down into the vision area. We could have the headband plus a second, slightly flexible outer rim, strong in the same direction as the headband, rigidly attached to the headband at the 2 sides of the head. (Note that it might want to be less tall than the headband, because space between the vision area and a hypothetical bicycle helmet is limited, while the headband can go lower; being less tall is okay because the rim doesn't need to be as strong, since it's not really holding up anything.) The only question is what to use to block air passing between the headband and the rim. Cloth is a possibility, but we'd need a way to keep it taut, to prevent it from getting into the vision area. A rigid object isn't possible, but maybe an accordionlike solid could work?

Hmm, there could be a bunch of parallel curved slightly-flexible rims, dividing the space up like a grating. That could look super cool and also help keep cloth from drooping.

If I do use cloth on the forehead area, that combines this with the other main design challenge, which is how to attach the cloth conveniently. Cloth for the forehead might also reduce the amount of noise (by reducing the amount of solid interior surfaces that reflect sound back to the wearer)

For the chin cloth:
– To attach it to the frame, I'm thinking we can just make the elastic be sewn into the cloth and have a loop at each end, which goes over a hook built into the frame; it doesn't need to be adjustable. Then it's just a matter of making it easy to set into the frame (perhaps by making the contact surface rotate with the normal to the curve, plus making some cutaways in the sides of the channel so that you can get your fingers in to press it into the channel). Note that in order to form a good seal, we only need the elastic to hold the cloth taut onto the frame, which automatically happens if it's in the normal direction, as long as the curvature isn't too low. The curvature near the top is pretty low; we might need a technique to fix this, or it might become moot due to other changes. The channel doesn't need to have solid walls on the non-normal sides, it could theoretically just be rows of prongs that keep the elastic from sliding off.
– To attach it to the neck, we can do the same thing except that it now needs to be adjustable – but the elastic can be bent over the headband and attached to one of *several* hooks at different positions down the outside frame (which I guess have to be in front of the place the cloth attaches to the frame...)
– Wait, just doing both of those things means the cloth is loose at the top corner, creating a leak. This could be resolved by putting an additional, very short piece of elastic between the ends of the chin elastic and the end of the frame elastic (elastic short enough that it will be taut around the frame even when the neck elastic is at the loosest hook, but inside a cloth tube long enough that it can reach the tightest hook)
– None of these techniques make the cloth itself taut, so they don't immediately solve the forehead thing
– since the forehead thing shouldn't be flexing all that much, an exact-sized cloth might be good enough
– To deal with the intake, try to route the cloth-channel BEHIND the intake rather than in front of it
– New idea: with apologies for trying to describe a 3D shape in text: the channel on the side/bottom rim only needs to go up to around Z=-70, from which the remainder of the side frame is almost vertical. If we can put a nonconcave surface on the faceward side of the frame above that, then the elastic can be pulled taut along that whole nonconcave surface, then go over the headband and hook onto a hook on the outside of the headband. Then it only needs to hook in *one* place on each side rather than two, simplifying the design significantly. (The only reason we still need a channel on the rest of the frame is that the bottom of the mask isn't *straight*). This allows the frame to be slimmer at the sides, allowing the sides to go less far back near the ears while still staying out of the vision area.

The current design assumes that the face does not get wider as you move down from the temple. But some people have faces that do that. We don't necessarily need to PERFECTLY avoid the edges of the vision on all faces; it would be tolerable to have the side of the mask end in a vertical edge that bows outwards along with whatever point of the cheek sticks out the furthest. If the frame is slightly flexible, the face shield can afford to bow outwards in approximately this way. (It can unroll along the cone.) What we want to avoid is the case where bowing the face shield also bows out the headband, losing the seal. To accomplish both of these things at the same time, there cannot be a direct attachment between the headband and the corner of the shield. That seems fairly complicated to pull off while also attaching the cloth appropriately. Another possibility is to let the face shield bow to a position where the cheek DOES stick out further than the temple. A third possibility is to just make the mask wider at the cheek regardless, SLIGHTLY reducing the visual range.



Additional notes after completing second prototype:
– the intake applies significant torque to the face shield, twisting the clear plastic. Right now, the frame around the intake is very bendable; below the intake, this is a good thing to help the mask's "one-size-fits-all"-ness, but above the intake, it's flexing in the wrong direction. This doesn't seem to be a huge problem, but should still be avoided if possible.
– Despite being much more "one-size-fits-all", it didn't fit someone with glasses. I'll probably have to change the generalized cone shape.
– Right where the top rim meets the headband, it's very easy for the headband to bend the top rim inwards, making it slightly concave. I'm not sure if this is a problem in practice, but theoretically it bends the face shield in an undesired direction and worsens the seal with the forehead cloth.
– The back part of the headband is pretty flexible, such that if you grab just one side of the back, the mask will flop around. It would be preferable if it was more rigid (e.g. if we made the headband wider in the back, which may be desirable anyway).
– The nose-air-replacement is pretty good, but consider whether a grille to direct the air towards my nose could improve it more.
– The chin cloth had several problems:
– – When using the brown elastic, it was much too tight (which makes the cloth harder to install; causes direct discomfort on the chin; pulls down the headband, causing more discomfort at the forehead; makes the mask harder to put on; and puts too much force on some of the weak glued-together joints of the frame).
– – I switched to using a much thinner white elastic, and then it was mostly fine on the chin, but didn't grip the frame quite well enough. The main problem point is around the intake; proposal: don't make gaps in the elastic plate, just fully route it in a curve around the intake. Similarly, we can route the elastic plates a short distance behind the bottom edges of the side plates, providing better grip and frame strength. (Note that, at that point, we can also make the elastic plate have an angled/FDM-printable edge, because there is no longer tension against that edge)
– – The bottom edge of the side plates isn't wide enough; probably we can just make the side plates a bit longer to fix this.
– – Even with the brown elastic, the cloth doesn't actually seal to the side plates. (This may be an acceptable sacrifice though, and in practice, people's faces will often press on it and improve the seal.)
– – The other point where frame strength is a problem is the joint between the sides and the headband. This MIGHT be resolved by printing them as one piece using SLS, but even with SLS, it might be advantageous to print as 2 separate pieces for "arranging more copies into the print volume" reasons. Fortunately, there is no downside to making the frame thicker at the temples (doesn't get in the way of vision, bicycle helmet, OR headphones). So maybe I can design something like a mortise-and-tenon joint there. Another joint in the same place could attach the top rim to the headband as a separate piece, if that would be desirable for any reason.



Let's think about the ideal shape for the face shield to accommodate glasses. What are the technical requirements on the face shield shape?
– Must be a generalized cone
– The point of the generalized cone – which I will call the "focus" – must be either above or below the whole face, otherwise it's weird
– For vision reasons, a few other points are required to be on the cone: a point under the chin, and points very close to the temple and the cheek under it. Also, the lines between these points and the focus cannot intersect the face.
– The entire surface must be convex.
– Let's assume that the focus is horizontally centered on the face. That's not technically required, but not doing it would be ridiculous.
– I measured some moderately bulky glasses as 132 mm across. There must be a point on the cone that is slightly outside of this; further, the line between the glasses-point and the focus must have a third point on it for the frame, which must be outside your vision.

Convexity imposes some interesting restrictions. We can think of it in terms of a view from the focus: with the camera at the focus, all points on the surface can be projected as a 2D curve, and that curve must be convex. So, when we are given any set of required points in 3D, we must find a position of the focus such that those points can be convex. In particular, the glasses point cannot appear outside the line-segment-ish from the temple. (And it's presumably below that line segment.) Therefore, the Y position of the focus must be ... [quick approximations]... either > 490, or < headphones_front (i.e. behind her and and below the face). (Note that in some sense, it wraps around, and values behind the face are greater than any value in front of the face, so this is basically one inequality, not two separate cases.)

Since we prefer not to have flat parts of the shield, it's ideal if the temple "line segment" projects to as short a segment as possible. This suggests that the focus should be BEHIND the face – moderately behind headphones_front, and therefore below the face. (Note that if the focus is too close behind headphones_front, it would project to a line segment going perpendicularly away from the face, which would need to bend too *sharply* in order to get to the front part of the face shield; putting the focus further behind headphones_front makes it diagonal enough to be fine).



Additional notes after prototype #3:

– It runs into my nose more now, and it runs into another tester's nose also. It seems like my model now mistakenly touches (0,-7,0) instead of (0,0,0) like the last version. And also, the physical version is another ~3mm inwards from the model at its default position. I think it's because the top rim is less pointy, and therefore more able to bend inwards at the nose. I should probably just reduce shield_focal_slope to make the forehead stick out more for the same chin position
– The back parts of the headband still flex rather easily, and I still need a more convenient way to clip it together at the back.
– The clips that were supposed to hold the forehead cloth to the headband broke off
– The chin cloth pulls over the shield a bit more than it should on the non-intake side (but is fine on the intake side)
– a small amount of air leaks out at the temple (a small amount of torque from the intake hose bends the frame away from the face, causing the headband to form a triangle of airspace that can't be closed by the elastic-cloth-edge; the CPAP grabber can fix this, but it's preferable to make it impossible to leak by accident).
– We still need a way to make the headband more comfortable (I glued some foam on, but it's not the perfect foam for the job and also it's not very washable)
– This version has WAY less reflections because the shield surface normals mostly point towards the face instead of places where there can be bright light
– Eventually, the temple joint deformed (wasn't strong enough)


Additional notes after (never-completed) prototype #4:
– the temple joint needs reinforcing to prevent the upper side rim bending forwards and backwards
– the "flex but don't twist" wave got in the way of plugging the upper side ran into its whole (let's just plug it lower down)
– the upper side rim needs reinforcing to prevent it from twisting
– the side joint likewise needs to be reinforced to prevent twisting (once the upper side is no longer the weakest point)
– one of the forehead elastic hooks broke; also it would be nice to have "flex but don't twist" across the whole forehead, so maybe give up on the elastic hooks and just put the elastic on the human forehead again
– the chin positioning wasn't quite right; with the most comfortable headband position, I measured the shield around 19mm in front of my chin instead of the target 10mm.
– the overhead strap needs to be stopped from wobbling side to side
– the CPAP grabber was no good (you can't put the mask on while holding both hoses to the back of the head, and also it was unhelpful and thence the overhead strap all over the place); probably just get rid of it and rely on the mask stiffness to handle the hoses
– the hook and loop fasteners stick to your hair if you're not careful, and also a normal person might put them on wrong; try making a plastic valley around the hooks to help with these
– for my headphones, it might be nice to have the CPAP intakes about 5mm lower, but I think that might bump into my shoulders too much.

main things that need attention now: temple/upper side reinforcing; hook and loop valley; overhead strap wobble




Additional notes after prototype #5:
– we had some plastic deformation issues:
– – at the top of the 3 ridges at the front of the overhead strap (this was just some sort of 3D printing artifact)
– – between the overhead strap slots in the back (I had worried about this, but it seems practical to address by just stiffening it more
– The chin cloth piece came out a little too small (I slightly messed up cutting/sewing it, but I should investigate whether there's a design problem as well). Likewise, the forehead cloth ended up SLIGHTLY too small, leaking a little at my forehead. (That one was because it didn't account for the foam thickness.) And the shield was visible around the bottom edge, also because of the foam thickness.
– the rear overhead strap slot was too stiff (you could damage the strap while trying to insert it, and it was hard to adjust by just one tick at a time)
– thanks to the foam taking up space, the head sizing needs to be adjusted
– we got some fogging at the bottom in outdoor temperatures below 70F; it seems that the air is blown in at a position significantly above the place you exhale to, so the exhale target gets to remain moist
– after 3 month of use, the headband snapped under moderate leverage where it meets the left triangle block (only the flat part snapped, the wave didn't, and then I glued it back together)



Additional notes after prototype #6:
– The side hook isn't printable as-is; let's replace it with a nub
– The top hook should be moved closer to the temple (not a new issue); maybe we can use the same nub for both?
– The elastic doesn't exert enough torque on the temple block to resist the face shield torquing it the other way (by trying to flatten); this can probably be fixed by moving the elastic attachpoint away from the head along the x axis
– It was practical to wear with a bike helmet, but that means wearing it about a centimeter farther down than I usually do, which means the shield is significantly farther away from my face (due to both shield_focal_slope and the slope of my forehead). My particular bike helmet dips down at the temples, pushing the temple block down but not requiring the forehead to move, so the mask is slanted in a way that moves the shield even further from the face. The quick fix is to just change putative_chin, making the mask smaller.
– The headband also digs into my forehead a bit more in the biking position because the forehead is shaped differently down there on the eyebrows; I'm not worried about this for the moment.
– A fancier solution could theoretically move the temple block downwards in normal usage, allowing the front headband to be higher up than the temple block (and making the top edge of the face shield be a more complex curve), but this might have problems with torque moving the mask the wrong way in normal usage.
– Partly related to the bike position issue, it might now be helpful to redirect the air towards the face instead of along the shield surface; this should now be practical given the current design of the intake.



Additional notes after prototype #7:
– It finally works well with a bike helmet!!
– The chin cloth I made for prototype #5 didn't stay on the face shield very well, but the new, sized-for-#7 chin cloth did. This is strong evidence that the shape actually mattered.
– The positioning of the nub/slot (elastic hook replacement) worked fine, but both were too easy for the elastic to slide off of (even after getting the cloth sizing correct). In the case of the nubs, part of the problem is that they don't stick out far enough past the thickness of the shield itself, which I didn't account for.
– The mask has the "wants to tilt upwards" problem a bit, but this isn't a big problem (and it's unavoidably tilted with my bike helmet).
– The air redirection reduced fogging in cold weather by a lot.
– The shield tends to pop off the glue at the intake. This can be resolved by printing a short slot to hold onto it from the outside.
– Even after getting the chin cloth size correct, it still tended to slide off the shield at the top of the intake. I resolved this by putting a dot of glue on the outside of the shield at the convex corner; I could also resolve it by building a little prong into the 3d printed part (the printing direction isn't ideal but it should work, and I'd have to adjust the shield shape but that's easy enough).
– (after adding the temple extender hacks) The temple extender hacks seemed to keep it stable on my head much better even without a top strap (vague theory: the y-distance from forehead to end of the extender was about twice the y-distance from forehead to previous elastic attach point, so it could only wobble about half as much). But the temple extenders kept coming unglued, so I'll have to build them into a new full print.
– I did some experiments and got a more specific understanding of why the temple extenders helped: The primary force tipping the mask upwards comes from the CPAP hose itself. This applies a certain amount of *torque* to the mask. To counteract the torque using upward force at the temples, you need so much force that it actually lifts the forehead strap upwards along my forehead as well. But the temple extenders give you a longer lever, allowing you to exert more *torque* for less *force*.


Additional notes after prototype #8:
– The glue holding together the frame joint on the right side, and the glue holding the face shield to the 2 frame parts on the right side, all fell apart after about 3 weeks of use (perhaps due to cumulative stresses?). I initially figured I should add clips so that it can actually be held in at at least a few places, by tension in the printed part rather than tension in the glue. Later, I determined that I can just embed small screws using heat, so I don't need new clips, and can actually remove the clips that are already in the design.
– Feeding it with 2 CPAP hoses symmetrically made the air movement worse (even with slightly higher total airflow, it feels like I'm breathing worse, and the shield fogs up more). A quick test of taping two CPAP hoses on the *same* side suggested that that approach was plenty convenient, so the next version should probably be asymmetric again, with the CPAP connectors only on one side.
– Without a bike helmet, I wear it with the headband halfway up my forehead, which makes the air be targeted perfectly for my nose, but means the bottom of the face shield cuts off my vision a bit. With a bike helmet, it's forced downwards so the headband is on my eyebrows, which makes the air targeting a bit worse for my nose but better for my mouth (probably good, really). In both cases, the bottom lip of the shield could probably stand to stick out 2-3cm further down.
– The cloth has an issue with occasionally getting yanked off the face shield, and being nontrivial to put back on; I ended up holding it on with binder clips, which only mostly mitigated the issue. This suggests that I should develop a better way of attaching it. (Later note: I tested simply hot-gluing the cloth to the shield, and it seemed to work just fine - I was worried that it could get yanked off, but it didn't yield to any of my test yanks.) In the case of the chin cloth, the cloth also ended up STILL not being wide enough to have the mask part not tug on the chin-strap part during normal operation (I guess my models still didn't place the chin curve accurately, especially in the "headband halfway up forehead" position?) Also, the chin cloth leaks a little right in front of the ears (it's inherently vulnerable to that issue due to its low curvature at that location, but it might be aggravated by the chin-elastic tension not being well distributed due to the width issue). Note that this will be affected somewhat by extending the bottom of the face shield. 


Additional notes after prototype #9?:
– In the design for prototype #9, I considered removing the bits that stick down from the headband to connect to the side-struts, but decided not to do the extra design work because the current models worked fine. But this is worth revisiting – if I remove one of the two dropdowns, then it becomes more friendly to FDM printing, and if I remove BOTH, it potentially becomes much more packable (relevant to future mass-production). To remove both, you'd have to extend the intake strut all the way to the headband, which seems geometrically feasible even with FDM, but would take some adjusting.
